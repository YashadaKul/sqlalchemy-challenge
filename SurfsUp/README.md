# sqlalchemy-challenge
This is the 10th assignment for the Monash University Data Analytics Bootcamp. 
I have not been able to do the full assignment, as I had difficulty understanding some of the concepts. Hope to get time to go through the zoom videos in the near future and make a new attempt soon. 

My code is not in the climate_starter.ipynb file, but in the main_script.ipynb file.
